Q1. Set up a firewall and attach two client nodes to it. One client node should be a wordpress server and the other a Ubuntu desktop. Also make sure that xaviers.edu.in redirects to the wordpress server.

Server:
Virtual Box -> Create 2 Network Adapters .
PFSense -> Set both adapters as 'Bridged Adapter'.

1. Type ip address from pfsense into browser.
2. Login to pfsense (user: admin password: pfsense)
3. Setup pfsense -> ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
4. Hamburger menu -> Services -> DNS Resolver -> Host override
5. Enter xaviers and edu.in and the ip of the destination from bitnami.

Client:
1. Run bitnami wordpress server (make sure network adapter = bridged)
2. Run ubuntu (make sure network adapter = bridged)
3. Enter xaviers.edu in browser.

Q2. Set up a firewall and let it have control over two networks: internal and bridged. One client should be on the bridged network and the other on the internal network. Make sure that the client on the internal network can ping the client on the bridged network.

Server:
Virtual Box -> Create 3 Network Adapters.
PFSense -> Set 1st adapter as 'NAT'
	   Set 2nd adapter as 'Host Only'
	   Set 3rd adapter as 'Bridged Adapter'

1. Type ip address from pfsense into browser.
2. Login to pfsense (user: admin password: pfsense)
3. Hamburger menu -> Interfaces -> Assignments -> Add (Created a new interface: OPT1)
4. Hamburger menu -> Interfaces -> OPT1 -> Enable -> scroll down, ipv4 - choose: static -> Add ip address (192.169.2.1), subnet mask - 24 -> save changes
5. Hamburger menu -> Services -> dhcp server -> OPT1 -> scroll down, range -> add-range -> 192.168.3.4 - 192.168.3.254 -> save
6. Firewall -> rules -> lan -> copy ethernet rules (ipv4 and ipv6) -> Change lan to opt1 -> save and apply changes

Client:
Connect to pfsense in browser (Should use internet of the server).

To access pfsense use 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1
